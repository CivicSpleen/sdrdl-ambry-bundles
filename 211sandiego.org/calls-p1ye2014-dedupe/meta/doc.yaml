        \ for every combination of values in all of the multi-valued fields. So, if\
        \ a call has three fields that have multiple values, with 2, 3, and 4 values\
        \ seletced in the respective fields, there will be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 records\

    readme: '# Deduplicated 211 Calls


        The 211 call dataset expresses multiple values in a field with multiple records,
        one for each value in a field, multiplied over all of the multiple values
        in fields that have multiple values. This bundle collapses those records into
        one.'
