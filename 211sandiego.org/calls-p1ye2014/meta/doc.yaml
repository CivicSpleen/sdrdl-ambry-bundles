        \n\n## Caveats\n\nThere are three columns that have code columns, but probably\
        \ shouldn't. Code columns are extra columns to hold values that are not of\
        \ the right datatype, such as letter code in an integer column. The columns\
        \ in the `calls` table with codes are: \n\n* hshld_pct_fpl\n* zip\n* hshld_size\n\
        \nThe code columns have the same name as the source column, appended with\
        \ `_code`. Note that this means that the `zip_code` column does not hold a\
        \ zip_code, it holds the non-numeric values from the `zip` column. \n\nAnalysts\
        \ should example the unique values for the `hshld_pct_fpl_codes` and `hshld_size_codes`\
        \ columns before using the source columns. \n\n\n\n\n"
