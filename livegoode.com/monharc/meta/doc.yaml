    main: "\n# Disciplary referrals at the Monarch School\n\nRecords of teacher's\
        \ referrals of students to the Monarch School's D12 \"Time Out\" room\n\n\
        The Monarch referrals data set documents and codes each incident in which\
        \ a student is sent out of the classroom for a behavior issue.  At Monarch,\
        \ when students are sent out of the classroom to address a behavior, they\
        \ are sent to the D-12 Room.  D-12 stands for the \"Definite Dozen\" .  This\
        \ is the name of the behavior management system utilized at Monarch.  D-12\
        \ refers to the 12 principles that all students and staff work toward embodying\
        \ in their behavior when at The Monarch School.  \n\nWithin the data set,\
        \ you will find the student ID, name, date and time the behavior incident\
        \ occurred, where it occurred, which staff member referred the student, which\
        \ actual classroom the student belongs to, what misbehavior was committed\
        \ and the consequence students faced.\n\nThis data is useful for Monarch so\
        \ they may be able to uncover patterns around behavior that are occurring\
        \ in specific student populations, grade levels, or if there is more or less\
        \ of any one type of behavior.  Monarch is also interested in understanding\
        \ the behavior patterns that may emerge with those students that stand out\
        \ by exhibiting more than the average number of behavior problems. This data\
        \ can then be used to help Monarch Administration better train teachers to\
        \ manage behavior challenges and to help individual students understand their\
        \ own behavior patterns over time.\n"
