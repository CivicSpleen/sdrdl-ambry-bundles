<h1>San Diego County Places</h1>
<p>This bundle includes a partition that holds the names and boundaries for San Diego County cities, and within the City of San Diego, council districts, neighborhoods and communities. </p>
<p>It also includes two crosswalks, linking all of the geometries to blockgroups and tracts. Since some of the blockgroups and tracts cross boundaries, a collectio of blockgroups or tracts associated with a geometry will not have the same boundary as the geometry. However, the blockgroups and tracts that cross boundaries are primaryily large with low populations, so this problem has a larger effect on area than for population. </p>
<p>The mismatch between San Diego communities and  blocks and tracts is particularly poor for the communities of:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Pasqual</li>
<li>Black Mountain Ranch</li>
<li>Del Mar Mesa</li>
<li>Fairbanks Ranch County Club</li>
<li>Villa De La Valle</li>
<li>Mira Mar Ranch North</li>
<li>East Elliot</li>
</ul>
