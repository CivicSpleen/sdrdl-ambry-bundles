# San Diego County Places

This bundle includes a partition that holds the names and boundaries for San Diego County cities, and within the City of San Diego, council districts, neighborhoods and communities. 

It also includes two crosswalks, linking all of the geometries to blockgroups and tracts. Since some of the blockgroups and tracts cross boundaries, a collectio of blockgroups or tracts associated with a geometry will not have the same boundary as the geometry. However, the blockgroups and tracts that cross boundaries are primaryily large with low populations, so this problem has a larger effect on area than for population.
