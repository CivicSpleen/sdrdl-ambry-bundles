*{about_summary}*

The City of San Diego's [Development Services]({external_documentation_agency_url}) [OpenDSD Website]({external_documentation_dataset_url}) provides map interfaces, as well as direct data downloads, of key data objects related to development permits, projects and approvals. 

This bundle provides tabular versions of the permit and application records that are avilable from the [dataset download page]({external_documentation_download_url}). As of version 0.02 of this bundle, the XML files used in this bundle are published by the San Diego Regional Data Library, having been recieved from Development Services on a USB stick. The download page links to XML files for recent objects, and will eventually have links to all of the same export data that the library acquired directly.
