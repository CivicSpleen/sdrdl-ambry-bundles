<p><em>XML Exports of summaries of applications and permits, exported from the City of San Diego Project Tracking System.</em></p>
<p>The City of San Diego's <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services">Development Services</a> <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/opendsd/">OpenDSD Website</a> provides map interfaces, as well as direct data downloads, of key data objects related to development permits, projects and approvals. </p>
<p>This bundle provides tabular versions of the permit and application records that are avilable from the <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/opendsd/developers.shtml">dataset download page</a>. As of version 0.02 of this bundle, the XML files used in this bundle are published by the San Diego Regional Data Library, having been recieved from Development Services on a USB stick. The download page links to XML files for recent objects, and will eventually have links to all of the same export data that the library acquired directly. </p>
