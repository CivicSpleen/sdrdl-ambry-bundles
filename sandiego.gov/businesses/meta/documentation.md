# Business List for San Diego County. 

This list of businesses is published by the San Diego Office of the Treasurer. 

The businesses listed in the file have locations across the US, but usually have some presence in San Diego, such as a San Diego location or an owner that lives in San Diego part time. Unfortunately, there is no upstream documentation to explain why many of the business addresses are outside of San Diego.
