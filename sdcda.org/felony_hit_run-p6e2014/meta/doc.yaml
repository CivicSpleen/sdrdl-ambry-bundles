    main: "**Data from the San Diego DA's office about the prosecution results of\
        \ hit and run collisions that resulted in injury or death.**\n\nThis is a\
        \ conversion of felony hit and run data provided by the San Diego district\
        \ attorney. The file retains the original columns, with a few additions. The\
        \ most important of which is that the `Sentencing` column is broken out into\
        \ seperate components. Here are the column names and the original descriptino\
        \ from the `Sentencing` column. \n\n* `incar`\tAny Incarceration\n* `incar_county`\t\
        Prison Served in County Jail\n* `incar_life`\tLife and Life +\n* `incar_prison`\t\
        State Prison\n* `incar_local`\tLocal Custody\n* `prob`\tAny probation\n* `prob_formal`\t\
        Probation Formal\n* `prob_sum`\tProbation Summary\n* `prog`\tAny program\n\
        * `prog_child`\tChild Abuse Program\n* `prog_dv`\tDV Recovery Program\n* `work`\t\
        Any work\n* `work_furl`\tWork Furlough\n* `work_pub`\tPublic Work Service\n\
        * `work_vol`\tVolunteer Work Service\n\nThe values in the columns are in days,\
        \ converted from the original \"Years\" and \"Months\" ( 30.4 days per month.\
        \ )\n\nThe Names are heirarchical. For instance, when there is a value of\
        \ `10` in the  `prob_formal`, the same value will appear in the `prob` column,\
        \ allowing you to analyze either the specific types of probations, or the\
        \ general calss of all probation types.  \n\nAdditionally, the modifiers in\
        \ the `highest_charge` field are broken out into `highest_charge_mod`\n"
